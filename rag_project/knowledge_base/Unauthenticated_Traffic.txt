# NAME OF SECURITY SMELL
Unauthenticated Traffic
# DEFINITION OF SECURITY SMELL
This security smell arises when microservices allow requests to interact with their endpoints without requiring any form of authentication to verify the identity of the requester. Authentication is the process of confirming that a user or service is who or what they claim to be. When unauthenticated traffic is permitted, any entity, whether legitimate or malicious, can potentially interact with the microservice. This lack of identity verification can lead to anonymous execution of functionalities, making it impossible to log or audit user activity and potentially exposing underlying authorization failures. Allowing unauthenticated access can pave the way for misuse, abuse, and the exploitation of vulnerabilities, potentially resulting in unauthorized data access and denial-of-service attacks. If the exposed endpoints or APIs do not require any authentication mechanism (e.g., the absence of checks that verify tokens, sessions, or other credentials), this can be identified by analyzing the code. The lack of filters or checks on the authentication level exposes unauthenticated traffic, and this is usually evident during static code analysis.
