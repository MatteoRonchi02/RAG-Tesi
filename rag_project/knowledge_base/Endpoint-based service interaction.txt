#NAME OF ARCHITECTURAL SMELL
Endpoint-based service interaction 

#DEFINITION
It occurs when a service (x) directly invokes another service (y) using a 
hardcoded endpoint (such as a fixed IP address and port) instead of employing 
dynamic discovery or routing mechanisms (such as service registry, load balancer, 
or message broker). This behaviour makes the application fragile, since if service
y is scaled or modified (with new instances on different addresses), service x
will continue to reference the old endpoint, thus compromising the reachability 
of the new instances. 

#EXAMPLE
The Service A sends an HTTP request to Service B using the URL 
‘http://192.168.1.100:8080/api/v1/resource’. If Service B is scaled up and new 
instances are started on different addresses, Service A will not be able to reach 
them because it continues to refer to the hardcoded address ‘192.168.1.100:8080’.
